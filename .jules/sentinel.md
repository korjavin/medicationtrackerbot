## 2025-04-18 - Missing Session Rotation on Authentication
**Vulnerability:** Session Fixation / Lack of Session Rotation (TM-010)
**Learning:** `createSessionToken` generated a deterministic token using only the user's email and server secret. Consequently, re-authenticating issued the exact same token value without rotation. A compromised token would remain valid indefinitely without explicit state tracking or embedded expiration.
**Prevention:** Incorporate a random component (e.g., a nonce) and a creation timestamp into the signed payload (e.g. `email|nonce|timestamp`) to ensure the token uniquely rotates on each issuance and allows the server to enforce an expiration window.
## 2026-04-18 - Unbounded HTTP Client Defaults in JWKS Fetch
**Vulnerability:** Resource exhaustion / Denial of Service via unbounded external HTTP fetches.
**Learning:** Initializing an `http.Client` with only a generic `Timeout` (e.g., 30s) leaves it vulnerable to Slowloris, hanging TLS handshakes, or decompression bombs if the underlying `Transport` defaults and response body reads (`io.ReadAll`) are unrestricted.
**Prevention:** Always explicitly configure a custom `http.Transport` (setting `DialContext`, `TLSHandshakeTimeout`), enforce a `context.WithTimeout` on the request, and wrap `resp.Body` in an `io.LimitReader` when reading external JSON payloads.
## 2025-04-19 - XSS Vulnerability in HTML String Replacement
**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via `r.Host` injected using `strings.ReplaceAll` instead of `html/template`.
**Learning:** Because the project serves HTML by reading static files and injecting variables (like `r.Host` or environmental overrides) via `strings.ReplaceAll`, it bypasses the automatic context-aware escaping provided by `html/template`. Unsanitized HTTP headers or external inputs injected directly into HTML payloads can lead to XSS.
**Prevention:** Always explicitly wrap injected variables derived from HTTP requests or external sources with `html.EscapeString()` when using string substitution for templating.
## 2026-05-20 - Fail-Open Default in OAuth Authorization
**Vulnerability:** OAuth validation bypass granting access to all health data (TM-001, TM-008) via empty allowlist.
**Learning:** `isSubjectAllowed` defaulted to returning `true` when the `MCP_ALLOWED_SUBJECT` configuration was empty. This fail-open behavior in critical authorization logic allows any authenticated identity (even those belonging to other users or external systems) to access the system if the configuration is inadvertently omitted or cleared.
**Prevention:** Always enforce fail-closed behavior during request validation. Ensure critical authorization configurations (like allowlists) are explicitly required at server initialization, and deny access by default if authorization parameters are missing or empty.
